<p align="left" title="Źródło 'Wikipedia'"> The United States of America (USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S. or US) or America,
    is a country comprising 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various
    possessions.

<p align="justify"> During the second half of the 19th century, the Civil War led to the abolition of slavery.
    By the end of the century, the United States had extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy,
    driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution, began to soar. The Spanish–American War and
    World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power.
